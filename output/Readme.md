How to read the names of the json files: 

example: final-01-07.json
	-> "final" ie has the color names for each pair of concepts and their combinations of "low us, high mg" etc... 
	-> Json data for which dsL = 0.1 and dsH = 0.7

example: full-01-07.json
	-> same as the "final" json dataset but the hex and Lab values are added to the color names.
