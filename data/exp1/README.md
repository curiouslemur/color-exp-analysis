Data whose file name includes the string "-alt-" indicate that the data is stored in another firebase database '...-alt'

This was necessary because of firebase limit on numbers of read and write per project.


The data to work with are in csv/clean/ 
- p3-mg (raw data)
- p3-us
- p3-mg-weight (data with average ratings and SE for each color and concept)
- p3-us-weight


For the 2026 project, the data to work with are in 2026/
- mg-dem
- mg-df
- us-dem
- us-df
The \*-df csvs are verified to be the same copy as the old p3-\*  csvs.
